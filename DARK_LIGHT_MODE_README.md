# Dark/Light Mode Feature Implementation

## Overview
This pull request introduces a comprehensive dark/light mode toggle feature to the Vaccination Portal, providing users with enhanced accessibility and personalized viewing preferences.

## Changes Made

### 1. Theme Context System (`src/context/ThemeContext.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized theme state management
- **Features**:
  - Persistent theme preference using localStorage
  - Automatic theme detection and application
  - Global theme state accessible throughout the application
  - Smooth transitions between themes

### 2. Theme Toggle Component (`src/components/ThemeToggleButton.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: User interface for theme switching
- **Features**:
  - Intuitive button design with clear visual feedback
  - Responsive design for all screen sizes
  - Accessible ARIA labels for screen readers
  - Real-time theme switching without page refresh

### 3. Comprehensive Theme Styling (`src/theme.css`)
- **Purpose**: Complete dark/light mode styling system
- **Features**:
  - **Global Styles**: Background and text color transitions
  - **Component-Specific Styles**: Individual styling for:
    - Dashboard components
    - Form inputs and buttons
    - Cards and containers
    - Navigation elements
    - Hero sections
  - **Smooth Transitions**: 0.2s ease transitions for all color changes
  - **Consistent Color Palette**: Harmonized dark/light color schemes

### 4. Tailwind Configuration (`tailwind.config.js`)
- **Purpose**: CSS framework integration
- **Features**:
  - Dark mode class-based strategy
  - Extended utility classes for dark mode variants
  - Consistent with existing Tailwind setup

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
// Theme state persistence
const [theme, setTheme] = useState(() => localStorage.getItem('siteTheme') || 'light');
```

### CSS Architecture
- **Class-based approach**: Uses `.dark` and `.light` classes on `<html>` element
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Extensive use of CSS variables for maintainability
- **Component Isolation**: Each component has dedicated dark/light styles

### Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for theme toggle
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and announcements
- **High Contrast**: Maintained WCAG compliance in both themes

## User Experience Improvements

### Visual Benefits
- **Reduced Eye Strain**: Dark mode reduces blue light emission
- **Battery Saving**: Dark mode saves battery on OLED displays
- **Personalization**: Users can choose their preferred viewing mode
- **Consistency**: Unified theme across all application components

### Performance Optimizations
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Efficient state management prevents unnecessary updates
- **CSS Transitions**: Smooth 0.2s transitions for visual continuity
- **Local Storage**: Persistent theme preference across sessions
